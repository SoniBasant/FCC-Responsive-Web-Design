## My process

This is my second project in FCC. The sample given for this project is very basic one. I wanted to make this form better than the sample. So I added differnt types of options to choose in form. Along with this, I also added HTML5 validation for _Name_ and _email_. To make the page good looking, I used a background image and a collage of images on the theme of the project, that is Northest.

I used JavaScript on the credit of the images; so that you can show and hide credit on click.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive on Mobile Screen

### What I learned

As this is form project, so I learn many concepts related to this. I implemented -

- input, label, placeholder
- drop-down
- checkbox
- radio
- textarea
- submit button
- Pseudo element on body for background image
- @media query
- flex-box
- transition, transform, scale() on images

After learning about semantic elements, I use them to replace _div_, like -

- header
- form
- blockquote, cite
- footer

To make cerdit section dynamic, I used JavaScript.

- getElementById
- addEventListener("click")
- arrow function
- classList.toggle

### Continued development

Need to work on "Thank you" message. I will learn UI/UX in my Frontend Web Development journey. As this is a form page, this project have lots of scope to improve. üí°üí°
