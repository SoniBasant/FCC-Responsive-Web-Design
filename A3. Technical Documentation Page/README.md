## Overview

This **Technical Documentation Page Project** is about **JavaScript Literals**. Using the reference of [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide), I made this project on JavaScipt Literals.

I used a lot of semantic and screen readable elements on content to make it structured, bold, coloured background, italic as per the requirement.

Documentation also have an interective navigation bar. I used JavaScript to show/hide navigation. You can also click on the screen to hide navigation.

## My process

This Technical Documentation project is different than the previous projects. It include bulk quantity of text. As too much style can distract the reader, so my main focus was on the text and to make it look good while reading. I also used JavaScript to hide / show navigation so you can get full screen for the content.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive on Mobile Screen

### What I learned

- navbar arrengements

- id selector, class selector, descendant selector
- @media query
- flex properties
- transform, translateX
- clamp on font-size
- :hover, :active

After learning about semantic elements, I use them to replace _div_, like -

- header

- main
- section
- article
- nav

For better screen reading, I used-

- strong

- mark
- em

### Continued development

**Latest Update :** Work on navigation, so that it will disappear after clicking on the page.

I will learn UI/UX in my Frontend Web Development journey. Let's see how I will improve this documentation page. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
