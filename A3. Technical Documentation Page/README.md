# FreeCodeCamp - Technical Documentation Page

This is solution to the Technical Documentation Page Project of [Responsive Web Design Certificate course on FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). FreeCodeCamp (FCC) help you to learn Web Development from the very basic with hands-on practice. After learning concepts, you need to make some web pages. Tasks in projects are defined by FCC and we need to complete those tasks.

## Overview

This **Technical Documentation Page Project** is about **JavaScript Literals**. Using the reference of [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide), I made this project on JavaScipt Literals. I used a lot of semantic and screen readable elements on content to make it structured, bold, coloured background, italic as per the requirement.

Documentation also have an interective navigation bar. I used JavaScript to show/hide navigation.

## My process

This is Technical Documentation project is different than the previous projects. It included bulk quantity of text. As too much style can distract the reader, so my main focus was on the text, to make it look good while reading. I also used JavaScript to hide/show navigation so that the view area focussed on the content.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive on Mobile Screen

### What I learned

- navbar
- id selector, class selector, descendant selector
- @media query
- flex properties
- transform, translateX
- clamp on font-size
- :hover, :active

After learning about semantic elements, I use them to replace _div_, like -

- header
- main
- section
- article
- nav

For better screen reading, I used-

- strong
- mark
- em

### Continued development

Need to work on navigation, so that it will disappear after clicking on the page. I will learn UI/UX in my Frontend Web Development journey. Let's see how I will improve this documentation page. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
