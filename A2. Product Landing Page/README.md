## Overview

This **Product Landing Page Project** is about **Color Keepers**. It contains a company logo, navigation bar, customized product icons taken from font-awesome, video related to a product, pictures of products along with price and a select button. Social media accounts for the company are also placed at the footer.

## My process

This is my third project in FCC. I choose an art-and-craft product which includes painting, DIY products, customized products etc. I used icons first time from _fontawesome_ website. Also I added a video, some images and social media links.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive on Mobile Screen

### What I learned

- navbar
- icons, from font-awesome
- video
- submit button
- child selector, universal selector, class selector, descendant selector
- @media query
- flex properties
- box-shadow

After learning about semantic elements, I use them to replace _div_, like -

- header
- main
- section
- footer

### Continued development

Need to work on "Thank you" message. I will use JavaScript for this. I will learn UI/UX in my Frontend Web Development journey. Product landing page is one of the top demanding web page, so this page will certainly need to improve. üí°üí°

Your suggestions are welcome. üôå
