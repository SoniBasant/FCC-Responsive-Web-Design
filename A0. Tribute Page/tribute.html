            <p>General Bipin Rawat was the first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and Permanent Chairman of Chiefs of Staff 
                Committee (COSC). As a first CDS of tri-services, he restructured the organization and made a clear path 
                for the combine functioning of all three forces. Making next generation war strategy, modernizing Indian 
                armed forces, promoting made-in-India products for self-reliance are one of the examplary services for our 
                country, India, and shows his future oriented and progressive thinking.
                <br><br>
                But the reasons because of which he became most loved general are to enhance the morale of the armed forces, 
                vocal for the nationalism and boost respect of armed forces in the eyes of the people. Whether it was Myanmar 
                strikes, Doklam stand off, supported and awarded an army major who, to save his man from lynching, use an 
                insurgent as a shield, highlighted two front war; he was always applauded by the nationalists.
