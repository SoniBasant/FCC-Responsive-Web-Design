## Overview

This **Tribute Page Project** is about **Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat**. He was the first CDS of India. I add his photo from his Wikipedia page, couple of his quotes, gallantry awards and a quote from PM Narendra Modi on Generals's death.

## My process

This is my first project in frontend. I read and practice many concepts on FCC. And after completing course on FCC, I started from the ground zero in Codepen, a online code editor. It was hard at first but I successfully made this project.

As the project is about an army man and the colour of army uniform is Olive Green, I chose this to be theme colour of the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive on Mobile Screen

### What I learned

As this is my first ever project, so I learn many basic concepts. I implemented -

- 'img' tag with 'src' and 'alt' attributes,
- 'ul' and 'li' tag
- 'p', headings like 'h1', 'h3'
- 'a' (anchor) tag for link
- 'id' selector, 'element' selector
- :root selector, :hover, overflow
- Lots of CSS properties of dimensions, box-model, image, font, color, ul

After learning about semantic elements, I use them to replace _div_, like -

- main, section
- figure, figcaption
- blockquote, cite
- strong

### Continued development

I will learn UI/UX in my Frontend Web Development journey. So lots of things will change in this project. üí°üí°
